Galaxy is a science fiction strategy 4X game in which several players compete to take control of planets, building armies and fleets and battling it out in the sky and on the ground. 

It is meant to be playable online, with the option of using either web or command line interface. 

The command line interface will be important for automatically testing the game, so that will be implemented first. 

The game server and ancillary tools will be written in Go.

The first step is to get space battles working. 

Galaxy is a game of strategy not tactics. Players do not exercise tactical control over fleets during battle; the actual battles are fully automated. 

Write a source file containing definitions to represent spaceships. 

Write another source file containing the procedure for running a space battle.
